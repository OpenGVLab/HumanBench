- **HumanBench** is a large-scale and diverse benchmark towards understanding human-centric 2d perception tasks, including Person ReID, Pose estimation, Pedestrain Attribute Recognition, Human Parsing, Pedestrain detection and Crowd Counting.
- **PATH** (**P**rojector **A**ssis**T**ed **H**ierarchical pretraining) is a extension of **SL-MLP**(https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00496) to Multitask pretraining methods. It can reduce task conflicts among different tasks.
- **UniHCP** (UniHCP: A Unified Model for Human-Centric Perceptions) is a unifed model for 5 human-centric tasks, including Person ReID, Pose estimation, Pedestrain Attribute Recognition, Human Parsing, Pedestrain detection, which shares 99.97% weights among different tasks.
