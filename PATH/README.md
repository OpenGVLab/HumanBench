Human-centric perceptions include a variety of vision tasks, which have widespread industrial applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, and the metaverse. It is desirable to have a general pretrain model for versatile human-centric downstream tasks. This paper forges ahead along this path from the aspects of both benchmark and pretraining methods. Specifically, we propose a HumanBench based on existing datasets to comprehensively evaluate on the common ground the generalization abilities of different pretraining methods on 19 datasets from 6 diverse downstream tasks, including person ReID, pose estimation, human parsing, pedestrian attribute recognition, pedestrian detection, and crowd counting. To learn both coarse-grained and fine-grained knowledge in human bodies, we further propose a Projector AssisTed Hierarchical pretraining method (PATH) to learn diverse knowledge at different granularity levels. Comprehensive evaluations on HumanBench show that our PATH achieves new state-of-the-art results on 17 downstream datasets and on-par results on the other 2 datasets.

## Hightlights

### $\text{\color{#2F6EBA}{A\ Large-scale\ and\ Diverse\ Human-Centric\ Benchmark}}$ 

- collected 11,019,187 pretraining images from 39 datasets among 5 tasks from global to local tasks.
- constructed 19 evaluation datasets from 6 tasks.
- 3 evaluation protocols to assess the generalization ability of pretrained models: in-datasets evaluation, out-of-datasets evaluation, unseen-tasks evaluation.

### $\text{\color{#2F6EBA}{A\ Projector\ Assisted\ Pretraining\ Method}}$ 

- Designed a Task-specific MLP Projector to Enhance Generalization Ability of Supervised Pretraining.
- Designed Hierarchical Weight Sharing Strategy to Reduce Task Conflicts.

### $\text{\color{#2F6EBA}{Push\ the\ Limits\ of\  Human-Centric\ Tasks}}$  
- Higher Performance than States-of-the-art Methods on 17 Datasets and On-par Performance than States-of-the-art Methods on 2 Datasets.
- Even the Tasks do NOT Exist in the Training Data.

## Installation
See [installation instructions](asset/INSTALL.md).

## Data
See [data instructions](asset/DATA.md). 

We also provide a small training config, with 10% samples of the whole pretraining dataset. 

## Training
Download pre-trained MAE ViT-Large model from [here](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/mae/pretrain/mae_pretrain_vit_large.pth) and place the MAE pretrained weight mae_pretrain_vit_base.pth under core/models/backbones/pretrain_weights folder. 


```bash
## train ViT-B
cd experiments/L2_full_setting_joint_v100_32g
sh train.sh

## train ViT-L
cd experiments/L2_full_setting_vit_large_a100_80g
sh train.sh
```

## Evaluation
